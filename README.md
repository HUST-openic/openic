# Openic Project

For next generation of EDA design.

Current by:

- tauri (rc).
- Vite2 + Vue3 (Composition API) + Vuetify3 (Alpha).

Added:

- vue-router: for more flexible page navigation and display management as SPA.
- pinia: Web application state manager base on *store* for GUI runtime configuration. The default configurations for GUI start-up is still based on files like other general EDA tools.

Good luck.
